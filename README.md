# Substrate Analysis
### Author: Michelle Yiv
Analyzing substrate types and distribution in California MPAs as part of the Bren School of Enivronmental Science and Management Master of Data Science Program. This project will be completed by the MarineBioMaps team, consisting of Bailey Jorgensen, Madison Enda, and Michelle Yiv. 

## Purpose
There is still a need for statewide geospatial and statistical analysis of the distribution of habitat types within MPAs. 

This repository will show analysis integrating existing spatial habitat datasets to generate a substrate layer for defined habitat types described by the Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership.
