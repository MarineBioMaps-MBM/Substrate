# Substrate Analysis of California MPAs

### Author: Michelle Yiv
Analyzing substrate types and distribution in California MPAs as part of the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management Master of Data Science Program. This project will be completed by the MarineBioMaps team, consisting of Bailey JÃ¸rgensen, Madison Enda, and Michelle Yiv. 

## Purpose
There is still a need for statewide geospatial and statistical analysis of the distribution of habitat types within MPAs. 

This repository will show analysis integrating existing spatial habitat datasets to generate a substrate layer for defined habitat types as described by the Pacific Marine and Estuarine Fish Habitat Partnership.
